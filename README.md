## Shop Online - Northwind Database

I designed a shopping site with asp net core 3.1 using the northwind database. Instead of keeping the user shopping cart in the database, I preferred to keep it in session. I focused on clean coding for the sustainability of the project using layered architecture. I also created a manageable site by separating the admin area. All functionality works smoothly in my project, which I developed using nuget packages, which are widely used in the sector. The customer can add products to his basket, increase or decrease the product in his basket. They can continue their shopping or they can end their shopping. I implemented identity management by using microsoft identity management.

###### There are two different databases in the project. These; Northwind and Identity.
